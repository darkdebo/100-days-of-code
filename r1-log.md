# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Debojyoti Chakraborty]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jun 13 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
today i learn quickfind and quickunion.quickunion follow the tree data structure and quickfind follow the linear data structure.
implement in python.These use for Dynamic connectivity problem.

### R1D2
today I learn about adjacent matrix and adjacent list
in graph. Best way to learn them.and learn how to use termux
As a code editor.

### R1D3
Now in Day3⃣
What I done.....
I do some improvement in quick union algorithms with weigthtened 
Quick union and path compression to make more efficiently solve dynamic connectivity problems.
Now for time to learn some linear regression.

### R1D4
It's day 4⃣
Nothing done that day,I was
Going with my friends for some fun and we did some great fun.
But some reason my mind was upset.
For this I can't give any update
About challenge.
But this trip boost me for coding morea and complete this
