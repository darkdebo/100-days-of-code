# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Debojyoti Chakraborty]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jun 13 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
today i learn quickfind and quickunion.quickunion follow the tree data structure and quickfind follow the linear data structure.
implement in python.These use for Dynamic connectivity problem.

### R1D2
today I learn about adjacent matrix and adjacent list
in graph. Best way to learn them.and learn how to use termux
As a code editor.

### R1D3
Now in Day3âƒ£
What I done.....
I do some improvement in quick union algorithms with weigthtened 
Quick union and path compression to make more efficiently solve dynamic connectivity problems.
Now for time to learn some linear regression.

### R1D4
It's day 4âƒ£
Nothing done that day,I was
Going with my friends for some fun and we did some great fun.
But some reason my mind was upset.
For this I can't give any update
About challenge.
But this trip boost me for coding morea and complete this

### R1D5
Let's celebrate day5âƒ£
Today I studied about
âœ…Time complexity and various notations.
âœ…Some regression models 
Like linear regression and polynomial regression.
âœ… Practice some questions to get the Bigg very big ðŸ…¾.
âœ“try some video on graph.

Day6âƒ£--------->
Done only
âš¡âš¡ linked list and it's
Some properties add,remove, enumeration.
âš¡âš¡Some basics of stack.
