The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jun 13 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
today i learn quickfind and quickunion.quickunion follow the tree data structure and quickfind follow the linear data structure.
implement in python.These use for Dynamic connectivity problem.

### R1D2
today I learn about adjacent matrix and adjacent list
in graph. Best way to learn them.and learn how to use termux
As a code editor.

### R1D3
Now in Day3âƒ£
What I done.....
I do some improvement in quick union algorithms with weigthtened 
Quick union and path compression to make more efficiently solve dynamic connectivity problems.
Now for time to learn some linear regression.
