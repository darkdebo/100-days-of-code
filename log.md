R1D1
today i learn quickfind and quickunion.quickunion follow the tree data structure and quickfind follow the linear data structure. implement in python.These use for Dynamic connectivity problem.

R1D2
today I learn about adjacent matrix and adjacent list in graph. Best way to learn them.and learn how to use termux As a code editor.

R1D3
Now in Day3âƒ£ What I done..... I do some improvement in quick union algorithms with weigthtened Quick union and path compression to make more efficiently solve dynamic connectivity problems. Now for time to learn some linear regression. #100DaysOfCode #301DaysOfCode

R1D4
It's day 4âƒ£ Nothing done that day,I was Going with my friends for some fun and we did some great fun. But some reason my mind was upset. For this I can't give any update About challenge. But this trip boost me for coding morea and complete this ' v #100DaysOfCode #301DaysOfCode

R1D5
Let's celebrate day5âƒ£ Today I studied about white_check_markTime complexity and various notations. white_check_markSome regression models Like linear regression and polynomial regression. white_check_mark Practice some questions to get the Bigg very big ðŸ…¾. âœ“try some video on graph. #100DaysOfCode #301DaysOfCode iphoneâš¡

R1D6
Day6âƒ£---------> Done only âš¡âš¡ linked list and it's Some properties add,remove, enumeration. âš¡âš¡Some basics of stack. #100DaysOfCode #301DaysOfCode

R1D7
Day 7âƒ£ was going little slower, Do some study on âœ“heap data structures and max,min heap. that's all #100DaysOfCode #301DaysOfCode #Algorithms

R1D8
Day8âƒ£ nice day it is-
